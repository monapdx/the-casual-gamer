## How To Customize

- **Change colors & fonts:** tweak values in the `:root` CSS custom properties or the `.css` file in the same folder.
- **Swap copy/content:** edit text inside the HTML. Keep the structure, replace the words.
- **Add images:** place your images in the same folder and reference them with a relative path (e.g. `./hero.png`).
- **Disable features:** comment‑out or remove event listeners in the JS files.
- **Mobile tweaks:** use CSS media queries (e.g. `@media (max-width: 640px)`).
- **Accessibility:** ensure sufficient color contrast, add `alt` text to images, and use semantic HTML elements.
