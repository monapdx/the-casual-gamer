      <h1>Little Red</h1>
      <p>As he gingerly poured the scalding liquid metal from one pail to another, mixing it with other concoctions, the steam from their great heat collided with the harsh cold of winter, making hissing noises and creating murals of smoke in the surrounding air. </p>
      
            <p>Mary didn't look for mermaids or dragons in those patterns of smoke and steam anymore; all she saw today was smoke. </p></p> 
            
                    <p>And blasé Mary no longer looked for satisfaction in those silvery lines hissing forth from father's lips anymore either. </p></p> 
                  
                        <p class="dialogue">"If you do not feel the need to love, Mary, do not worry; everyone loves you," he said to her, never taking his eyes off of his work. </p>


 <p>And he believed he spoke the truth. Perhaps he did, finally. 


 <p>Mary fought the caprice to wear clothes of comfort for a walk through the woods, realizing finally that comfort must fall after beauty.
 
 <p class="dialogue">"You might as well go to her now," suggested her father.</p></p> 
 
   <p class="dialogue">"Yes, I might as well," responded Mary, "for the old never die until we forget them, so that, that fabled part of us may die along and alone with them."</p>
 
 <p>This brought father's eyes upward to stare painfully at a daughter he could never have in knowledge, but only as Oedipus had Iocaste, in complete ignorance.
 
 <p class="dialogue">"What do you mean?" he asked her.</p></p> 
 
      <p class="dialogue">"Only that until the day no one runs to bring her bottles of molasses, no part of us can die with her on the day that she does, and surely those days will be the same. Love simply does not have the power to do these things alone, father. To defeat both life and a part of the living, love needs conscience as badly as we need to find mermaids in the smoke," she replied. </p>


 <p>And then she turned around, and in doing so, took mother's life and with it her curvature, to have father to herself, and she left him too.
 
 <p>But that is all the truth. Reality is quite set apart from truth.  </p>
                  
                  
    </p> 

     
      <p>As Mary forgot to march, and simply walked, in reality, mother's love was shed like baby fat, her doting on jaded Mary fasting through the days; a jealously accumulating during the night hours. A contempt plumping with little Mary's breasts. And oh, how mother wore it well, that jealously; a pretty perfume derived from the flower of Narcissus, which blooms still, looming over the lake, near to here. </p> 


   <p>As walking was forgotten, and reality and truth became enmeshed in love, Mary <a href="#" onclick="playSound('snowSound')">trudged</a>. And as she did so, she struggled to find some symbiosis between her and the faint fetters which bound her to this basket, which preordained her path, and guided her along it now. 


 <p>And she could see it as nothing but a parasite.
 
 <p>It was then that she came across a lovely white-­haired youth on his way past her, in the opposite direction. What a sight he was! His hair was completely white, not gray nor blonde, but white. He was tall and thin, but not gigantic not emaciated. His eyes were of obsidian.</p> 
 
   <p class="dialogue">"What is your name?" asked Mary as they approached one another.</p>
 
 <p>He looked genuinely taken aback at her speaking to him, but he quickly collected himself and scanned her, with a keen grin on his face.
 
 <p>"<a href="#" onclick="playSound('wolfSound')">Wolfie</a>," he answered. 


 <p>She smiled back at him. </p> 


      <p>His entire appearance gave off an altogether bohemian vibe, freedom from the fetters which bound Mary, and perhaps a key to free her from them as well.
 
 <p class="dialogue">"I'm Mary, Mary Manson," she said.</p>


 <p>She was then not so sure that she had been wise is telling a stranger, beautiful or not, her name. She tried to salvage this conversation by avoiding banalities and staying on her path, from this point on.</p> 
 
   <p class="dialogue">"Well, Mary Manson," he said, looking down at her white face framed in black, flaxen hair, "it was nice to make your acquaintance."


 <p class="dialogue">"Likewise," she said, "I'm on my way to my grandmother's house, would you like to walk with me? Or have you somewhere else to be?"
 
 <p>He looked even more surprised at this invitation, but his smile broadened in response. 


 <p class="dialogue">"I can think of nowhere else I would rather be, Mary, if that answers your question," he replied, and bold, he wrapped his arm around hers, the one that held the basket. 


 <p>And now it was her turn to show some obvious surprise, but she too quickly regained her suave composure, and they walked together, his pace slower to let her keep up, and her legs moving faster than he realized.</p> 
 
   <p>He looked at her, as her head turned, as the taut springs inside of her that were her young muscles contracted and shifted, making the azure veins beneath her chalk-­white skin, protrude ever so slightly. It was only that chalk skin that made them azure at all, that prevented them from showing themselves as the true blue they were, he was sure. 


 <p>Red ribbons of vice rallied in the wind, clinging to Mary's luminiferous black hair, limp though it still fell. </p> 


      <p>Overcome with tenderness and pure solace, Wolfie stopped dead, and stared at her, and she looked to him to find the cause of the stop.
 
 <p class="dialogue">"What is it?" she asked, and then after a pause, after noting his longing gaze, "what is it you want, Wolfie?" </p>


 <p>This sent his eyes fluttering shut, and made him repress a moan of adoration.
 
 <p class="dialogue">"To take every 'thou' and 'thee' from Shakespeare, and replace it with you, with Mary Manson," he whispered feverishly. </p>


 <p>She <a href="#" onclick="playSound('laughSound')">grinned</a> at this, loving the sight of his suffering as a true sadist would.
 
 <p class="dialogue">"I would claim to understand your poetry, Wolfie, but perhaps I can show you what I understand," she began, "Obligation binds me to this basket now, and so the path is determined to where it shall be left. Allow me to but leave it at the doorstep of my grandmother, and remain here until then. I will return to this very spot to show you my poetry." </p></p> 


      <p>He opened his eyes gradually, painfully almost.
 
 <p class="dialogue">"And how will you show it to me?" he asked of her.</p>
 
 <p class="dialogue">"The way all poetry is born, before it can be coupled with any mate; with my hands," she explained. </p>


 <p>And then she turned, and pulled her scarlet hood over her black hair, so that as she walked into the wind, Wolfie could see wisps of that hair curling outward, like spiders around the regal red; like leaves around the sun.  </p>
    </p> 
    
     
    <p>Unable to await her arrival, and seeing through her game, he simply took an alternative route to her grandmother's house, one which was less time, and with his long legs, took him very little time indeed to breach. </p> 


      <p>When he reached her house, and peered into the windows, he found her to be gone somewhere, to a neighbor's house most likely. And so he went in, finished making the tea that granny had started, and helped himself to a cup, as he sat at her oak table, waiting for Mary Manson to march up to the door. 


 <p>And soon enough she did. </p> 


      <p>When Wolfie answered the door, Mary's jaw dropped and she couldn't cloak her alarm. 


 <p>Immediately he offered her a gentle expression, a reassuring expression, and gestured for her to come inside.
 
 <p class="dialogue">"She wasn't here when I arrived," he informed her, to clear up any doubts in little Mary's mind.</p>
 
 <p class="dialogue">"I see," she  aid dubiously.</p></p> 
 
 
      <p class="dialogue">"Do you?" he questioned. </p>


 <p>Overcome with attraction to the enigmatic, to the beautiful, she merely grinned. 


 <p>He lied down on granny's bed and beckoned for her to join him. </p> 


      <p>She went to do so immediately, but stopped very near to him, and removed her red frock coat, letting it slip to the wooden floor. 


 <p>Lying next to him finally, he sighed and stroked her hair gently, allowing his long, thick nails to graze her soft scalp. Paralyzed by inertia, he magically continued to breathe as Mary's frame rested against his, her flesh pressing into his. 


 <p>That desperate attempt at penetration of flesh was suddenly more sinful than scraping every sugary particle of her young fluids with tongue to lap, or phallus to plumb. 


 <p>And as if knowing these thoughts and seeking to insult Wolfie, she reached then to the crotch of his pants, but he caught her by her lithe and fragile wrist before she ever got there. </section>


      <p>He shook his head solemnly, locking his eyes with hers. 


 <p>She looked confused.
 
 <p class="dialogue">"You wouldn't take the poetry I offer?" she mused.</p>
 
<p class="dialogue">"You say poetry must start with hands, but why is that, Mary?" he asked.</p>


 <p class="dialogue">"What do you mean?" she inquired, her brow knitting into a mermaid-less tapestry.</p>
 
<p class="dialogue">"Why must it begin with your hands?" he  persisted.
 
<p class="dialogue">Because it must be written," she explained, unsure. 


 <p class="dialogue">He nodded, grinning despite himself, but continuing in his playful, yet meaningful interrogation, "But why must it be written at all?" 


 <p>She looked even more perplexed still and remained silent in her confusion.
 
 <p class="dialogue">"Would you have me know your words, as any poet would?" he pressed.
 
 <p class="dialogue">"Yes," she replied confidently.
 
<p class="dialogue">"Have you hands  to  to write it?"
 
 <p class="dialogue">"Yes."


 <p class="dialogue">"Will you always?"
 
 <p class="dialogue">"No." 


 <p class="dialogue">"Ah, and why is that, my Mary Manson?"
 
 <p class="dialogue">"Because I will die."
 
 <p class="dialogue">"Yes, because you will die. What then is the purpose of immortalizing your poetry?"
 
 <p class="dialogue">"To keep it in the living's sphere."</p>
 
     <p>At this he closed his eyes. He kissed her innocently on the cheek, although she moved vigorously to meet his mouth. He placed his other hand on her thigh, moving it inward, feeling a hint of the sultry orifice beneath her red garments, but not daring to venture farther with any part of himself.
 
 <p class="dialogue">"To remember, Mary. To remember…and nothing more. Never anything more."
